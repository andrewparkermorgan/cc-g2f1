This repository contains supporting scripts for the manuscript:

High-Resolution Sex-Specific Linkage Maps of the Mouse Reveal Polarized Distribution of Crossovers in Male Germline. *Genetics* advance online publication 27 February 2014. doi:[10.1534/genetics.114.161653](http://dx.doi.org/10.1534/genetics.114.161653)

Organization is as follows:
* **./data**  input data files, namely the table of crossover events and their positions inferred from haplotype reconstruction in the G2:F1 population described in the text
* **./lib**  helper code for scripts
* **./scripts**  scripts to generate and analyze genetic maps
